  <em>Imagine a futuristic robot arm glowing with AI insights – preventing breakdowns before they happen!</em>
</p>

Welcome to **RobotGuard AI** — an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** that transforms raw sensor telemetry into actionable predictions for **six-axis industrial robots**.

In a high-stakes car manufacturing line with **2,000 robots**, unplanned downtime costs **$80,000 per hour**.  
RobotGuard AI acts like a **super-smart predictive mechanic**, forecasting **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** in hours and **failure modes** (bearing wear, gear tooth damage, overheating, etc.) — enabling **just-in-time maintenance** and potentially saving **millions annually**.

This project is more than code — it's a **complete ML engineering showcase**: synthetic data generation → cleaning → advanced feature engineering → hybrid modeling → real-time inference → beautiful Streamlit dashboard.

Let's dive in!

## Introduction

Robots are the backbone of modern manufacturing — but they fail. Traditional rule-based systems can't handle the complex, multi-modal patterns in vibration, torque, temperature, and current data.

**RobotGuard AI** solves this with:

- **XGBoost regression** → predicts **RUL** (hours until failure)
- **XGBoost classification** → predicts one of **5 failure modes**
- Synthetic data generation (real industrial datasets are rare and expensive)
- 80+ engineered time-series & spectral features
- A dark, futuristic **Streamlit dashboard** with live gauges and probability charts

Built as a **portfolio-grade project**, it demonstrates full-stack ML skills while being production-ready and easily extensible.

### Key Achievements from Development

- Handled **5.3M+ row datasets** on CPU (memory optimized from ~6.8 GB → ~1.5 GB)
- Achieved **R² ≈ 0.71** for RUL prediction on synthetic data
- Overcame class imbalance in failure modes with stratified splitting & class weights
- Containerized with **Docker** + **docker-compose** for easy deployment
- Automated workflow with **Makefile**, **pyproject.toml**, **GitHub Actions CI/CD**, and **Dependabot**

## Project Overview

RobotGuard AI delivers a complete predictive maintenance pipeline:

1. **Generate** high-fidelity synthetic telemetry (multi-modal degradation cycles)
2. **Clean** raw data (missing values, outliers, duplicates)
3. **Engineer** 80+ features (rolling statistics, FFT spectral features, gradients, cyclic encodings)
4. **Train** hybrid XGBoost models:
   - Regression: Remaining Useful Life (hours)
   - Classification: Failure mode (bearing wear, gear tooth, overheat, etc.)
5. **Infer** real-time predictions from raw sensor inputs
6. **Visualize** everything in a **dark, futuristic Streamlit dashboard**

**Business Story Example**  
In a car manufacturing plant, RobotGuard detects early **bearing wear** 24 hours before failure — saving **$1.92M** in downtime costs. That's the power of proactive AI.

**Highlights**
- Scales from 500K to 10M+ rows on CPU
- Time-series safe (no leakage, strict temporal splits)
- Memory-efficient (downcasting, selective column loading)
- Beautiful UI with Plotly gauges, progress animations & status badges

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Key ML Concepts

RobotGuard AI is built with a modern, efficient, and production-ready stack.  
Think of it as the **complete toolkit** for a next-gen predictive maintenance system.

### Core Language & Runtime
- **Python 3.10+**  
  Fast, readable, and the perfect foundation for ML engineering.

### User Interface & Visualization
- **Streamlit** + **Plotly**  
  Powers the dark, futuristic dashboard with real-time gauges, probability bars, and smooth animations.

### Data Processing & Storage
- **Pandas** + **NumPy** + **PyArrow**  
  Lightning-fast data wrangling, memory-efficient Parquet handling, and massive dataset support.

### Feature Engineering
- **SciPy** (signal processing) + **Custom rolling logic**  
  Extracts 80+ powerful features: time-domain stats (mean/std/min/max), FFT spectral analysis (RMS, peak frequency, entropy), gradients, and cyclic encodings.

### Modeling & Learning
- **XGBoost** (both regression & multi-class classification)  
  High-performance gradient boosting with early stopping, class weighting, and tuned hyperparameters for robust RUL and failure mode prediction.

### Preprocessing & Utilities
- **scikit-learn**  
  Reliable scaling (`StandardScaler`), encoding (`LabelEncoder`), and evaluation metrics.

### Deployment & Automation
- **Docker** + **docker-compose**  
  Containerized, portable, and ready for local or cloud deployment.
- **Makefile**  
  One-command magic: `make all`, `make train`, `make docker-up`, etc.
- **GitHub Actions** + **Dependabot**  
  Automated linting, testing, Docker builds, dependency updates, and CI/CD.

### Configuration & Project Management
- **YAML** (config/config.yaml)  
  Centralized control of pipeline parameters (windows, paths, training settings).
- **pyproject.toml**  
  Modern project metadata, scripts, and dependency management (editable install, dev tools).

This stack was chosen for **performance**, **readability**, **scalability**, and **developer joy** — while keeping everything CPU-friendly and production-grade.

Quick Start Guide
Prerequisites

Python 3.10+
Git
(Optional) Docker + docker-compose

1. Clone & Install
git clone https://github.com/hiteshjha2003/Industrial-Robots-Predictive-and-Classifier-System.git

cd Industrial-Robots-Predictive-and-Classifier-System
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Full Pipeline (Manual)
# 1. Generate synthetic data
python src/etl/synthetic_data_generator.py --mode sample

# 2. Clean
python src/etl/clean.py --mode sample

# 3. Build features
python src/features/build_features.py

# 4. Train models
python src/modeling/train.py --mode sample

# 5. Launch dashboard
streamlit run app/main.py
→ Open http://localhost:8501

### 3. Using Makefile (Recommended – one command magic)
####   make all    # Full pipeline: install → generate → clean → features → train → dashboard
####   make data         # Only generate data
####   make train        # Only train models
####   make streamlit    # Launch dashboard
####   make clean        # Remove generated data & models
####   make docker-up    # Run via Docker Compose

4. Docker Deployment
# Build image
docker build -t robotguard-ai .

# Run container
docker run -p 8501:8501 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data -v $(pwd)/models:/app/models robotguard-ai
Or with docker-compose:
docker compose up -d web
Dashboard → http://localhost:8501

Dashboard Features
Your command center — dark, futuristic, interactive:

Home — Overview, metrics, robot image
Generate Data — Mode selection, robot count slider, progress animation
Clean Data — One-click cleaning with spinner
Feature Engineering — Builds 80+ features, shows preview table & chart
Train Models — Trains XGBoost models, shows progress & metrics
Predict & Monitor — Real-time sensor input → RUL gauge (red/orange/green zones) + failure probability bar chart + JSON output

Pro Tip: Pipeline status badges (✅ / ⏳) remember progress via session state.

Expected Results (Sample Mode – ~5.3M rows)

Regression (RUL)
MAE: ~0.10 hours
RMSE: ~0.17 hours
R²: ~0.71 (strong for synthetic data)

Classification (Failure Mode)
Accuracy: ~0.70–0.85+ (after balancing)
Macro F1: ~0.65–0.80
(Early runs showed 0.001 due to imbalance → fixed with stratified split + class weights)

Runtime
Full pipeline: ~10–15 minutes on standard CPU laptop
Inference: <1 second per prediction



Customization & Next Steps
Make RobotGuard your own:

Add more failure modes in synthetic_data_generator.py
Expand features (more windows, kurtosis, wavelet transforms) in build_features.py
Try other models (LightGBM, CatBoost, TabNet) in train.py
Improve UI — add SHAP explanations, live trends, alerts
Scale — switch to Dask/Polars for 10M+ rows
Deploy — Render.com, Railway.app, AWS ECS, Fly.io
Monitor — add Prometheus metrics or MLflow tracking
